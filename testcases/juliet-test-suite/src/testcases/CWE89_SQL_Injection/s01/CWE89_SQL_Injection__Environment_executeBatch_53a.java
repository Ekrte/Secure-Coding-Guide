 * CWE: 89 SQL Injection
 * BadSource: Environment Read data from an environment variable
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded string
 * Sinks: executeBatch
 *    GoodSink: Use prepared statement and executeBatch (properly)
 *    BadSink : data concatenated into SQL statement used in executeBatch(), which could result in SQL Injection
 * Flow Variant: 53 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one method through two others to a fourth; all four functions are in different classes in the same package
