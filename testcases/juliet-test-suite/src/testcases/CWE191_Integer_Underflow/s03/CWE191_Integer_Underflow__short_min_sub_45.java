 * CWE: 191 Integer Underflow
 * BadSource: min Set data to the max value for short
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: sub
 *    GoodSink: Ensure there will not be an underflow before subtracting 1 from data
 *    BadSink : Subtract 1 from data, which can cause an Underflow
 * Flow Variant: 45 Data flow: data passed as a private class member variable from one function to another in the same class
