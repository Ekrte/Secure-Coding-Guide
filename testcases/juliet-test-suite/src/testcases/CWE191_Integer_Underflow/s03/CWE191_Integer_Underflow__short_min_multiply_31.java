 * @description
 * CWE: 191 Integer Underflow
 * BadSource: min Set data to the max value for short
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: multiply
 *    GoodSink: Ensure there will not be an underflow before multiplying data by 2
 *    BadSink : If data is negative, multiply by 2, which can cause an underflow
 * Flow Variant: 31 Data flow: make a copy of data within the same method
