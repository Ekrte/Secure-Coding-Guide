 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: max_value Set count to a hardcoded value of Integer.MAX_VALUE
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: for_loop
 *    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as the loop variant in a for loop
 *    BadSink : Use count as the loop variant in a for loop
 * Flow Variant: 54 Data flow: data passed as an argument from one method through three others to a fifth; all five functions are in different classes in the same package
