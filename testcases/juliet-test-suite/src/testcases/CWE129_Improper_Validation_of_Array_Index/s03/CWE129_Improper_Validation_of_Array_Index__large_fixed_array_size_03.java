* CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
* BadSource: large_fixed Set data to a value greater than the size of the array
* GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
* Sinks: array_size
*    GoodSink: data is used to set the size of the array and it must be greater than 0
*    BadSink : data is used to set the size of the array, but it could be set to 0
* Flow Variant: 03 Control flow: if(5==5) and if(5!=5)
